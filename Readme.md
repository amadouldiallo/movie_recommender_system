# Movies Recommender System

## Install conda 
Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others. 
Use the conda install command to install 720+ additional conda packages from the Anaconda repository.

**I use miniconda environment for this project. Install it may be very useful**
